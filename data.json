Although witches, oracles, and magic do not exist in the real world, a society can nevertheless construct a coherent belief system on the premise of their existence—one that supports the ordinary interactions of daily life and is central to establishing and maintaining moral order.

But a look at the daily lives of Wall Street insiders, and the myths, rituals, and rhythms of the financial world, reveals a culture where everything can be made liquid—that is, converted into a commodity to be bought or sold.

But why did abolition happen at this time, in this place? Davis believes the answer can be traced to another profound social change, happening in Britain at the same time: the growth of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. Capitalists needed a workforce that would accept low pay and harsh conditions. They also needed to minimize social resistance.

Countries that “developed” were those that became agricultural—thanks to native animals suitable for domestication and plants that could be cultivated. Hunter-gatherer societies remained “undeveloped.” Agricultural societies could diversify and develop technologies. Smaller countries, meanwhile, developed more than larger landmasses because of competition and communication with their neighbors.

Many managers feel their products are so good they will sell themselves with the help of advertising alone. But if potential customers do not believe in the product, they will not buy it.

So by rights, capital should flow quickly into poorer countries. Yet in reality, capital flow into these countries is more like a trickle—far less than mathematical models predict. The reasons why are not clear, but finding answers is important to the world’s developing countries. These answers may lie in the notion of human capital—the skills and experience that people bring to their work.

In other words, if unemployment is too high, you can reduce it by accepting a little more inflation. And vice versa.

Yet, despite pockets of enlightened whites struggling to build a more equal society, African Americans were prevented from becoming truly equal citizens.

But former Haitian slave Toussaint L’Ouverture lived out the ideas of liberty, equality, and brotherhood. After slaves first revolted in the French colony of San Domingo (present-day Haiti) in 1791, L’Ouverture was the charismatic leader needed to galvanize a mass movement against slavery. The colony was overthrown in 1803 and the Republic of Haiti was formed in 1804. It was at this point that the first truly regional identity in the postcolonial West Indies began to emerge.",

But for half a century, the war drove postwar events in all European nations, whatever their size or politics. While the conflict “ended” with Nazi Germany’s surrender in 1945, it had an ongoing influence, as each nation grappled with the memory of painful events. The postwar years also sparked agreement about creating economic safety nets through social democracy—a characteristically European phenomenon. Only when the Soviet bloc fell in 1991 did the war play out its final act.",

It was Hitler who deserved all the credit for national successes, both economic and political. It was Hitler who stood up for Germany’s rights.

It consisted of three interdependent core regions (Europe, the Middle East, and Asia) interacting on essentially equal terms, with major world cities and towns playing a crucial role in the network. The West’s rise to dominance in the sixteenth century was not because it was inherently stronger than other regions. Rather, it was because the East suffered even more than Europe from the crises of the fourteenth century. The devastating mid-century plague affected the entire Eurasian system, but the disintegration of the Mongol Empire and the collapse of what was known as the Mongol Peace exacerbated the effects of the plague in the East.",

Nor was it down to the differences between competing classes in America itself. The Revolution wasn’t even born out of the Enlightenment ideas of the philosopher John Locke that all men are born with certain inalienable rights. Rather, the ideas that sparked the American Revolution came from a more widespread and radical anti-authoritarian view that feared liberty throughout the English-speaking world was under threat, and that distrusted those in power as corrupt. This thinking dated back to the English Civil War over a century earlier. Revolution was needed above all to protect the liberty of society.",

            "Summary": "The tension between different social and economic classes led to Iraq’s 1958 revolution. Previously experts had claimed that social class could not be used to define Arab societies and that the religion of Islam kept both Western class structures, and communism, at bay. But technological change in Iraq, and integration into a capitalist economy, saw the rise of new social classes based less on cultural and religious factors, and more on property ownership and income. Differences between the new groups and the old establishment provided fertile ground for new ideas such as communism to take hold, and in turn to revolution.",

Social and political factors are clearly important, but the exchange of both food and disease between two continents was fundamental to the changes that followed Columbus’s journey from Europe to the Americas in 1492. High-calorie food crops exported from America led to massive population growth in the Old World, while the unintentional importation of smallpox caused massive loss of life and ensuing instability in the Americas. This shows us that human history must be understood not only in its political context, but in its ecological setting too.",

Ginzburg develops “microhistory”—focusing on particular events and individuals to investigate a broader idea—to examine transcripts from court hearings of the time in which the benandanti were themselves tried as witches.

They have no platform to voice their concerns and their interests because society excludes them from public debate. What’s more, when local elites (government officials, religious leaders, etc.) or Western scholars assume to talk for these poor—or indeed simply leave them out of historical accounts, or discussions of current issues—that is a form of violence. True, it is violence in the form of language. But such language is genuinely powerful because it can be used to support military domination, and physical violence too.",

It is films, adverts, and national pastimes that provide the messages that ultimately determine the values of society.

            "Summary": "Modern moral philosophy has no common standards of judgment agreed by all philosophers, so it can no longer tell people how to live a good life. There are no absolutes any more, since views on morality are seen as relating to a particular culture, society, or context. So it is necessary to go back to Aristotle and original concepts about virtues, morality, and politics to restore an essential function of the philosopher. MacIntyre goes against much modern liberal thinking and its emphasis on the individual. Instead, he supports the moral good life that, according to Aristotle’s ideas, must be lived in a community where every individual has a purpose.",

His greatest student, Aristotle, disagreed. Form does not exist without matter, he argues in his Metaphysics, employing a finely reasoned analysis of the nature of substance. When we discuss substance, we should be talking about objects, he argues, not their abstractions. Form is substance in matter.",

Ryle rejected this notion in its entirety on the grounds that mental processes could not so easily be isolated from the physical world. For example, knowing how to play a musical instrument is a case of putting thought into action, and when we observe the body we are actually observing the mind in action. The Concept of Mind challenges centuries of “dualist” thought, influencing the fields of philosophy and psychology by giving us a new way to think about the mind.",

This meant that no set of moral beliefs was better than any other—it was a matter of personal preference. This worried Lewis.

He does this by trying to establish foundations for knowledge. Starting off by doubting everything, Descartes shows we can discover what bits of knowledge lie beyond doubt, such as our own thought. “I think, therefore I am.” This leads on to the idea that the mind and body exist as separate substances, and to arguments that prove the existence of God, and as a consequence of that, the existence of the external world.",

But he was the first to argue that in following God’s will—which no one but God may fully understand—Abraham had acted ethically.

            "Summary": "American politician John C. Calhoun saw danger signs in democracy, since people run governments, and people are naturally self-interested. He was concerned that simple majority rule was open to abuse and that “the tyranny of the majority” would become a huge problem as elected leaders could promote their own interests. He proposed a system he called “the concurrent majority,” where minority groups (by which he primarily meant states in the Union) would be able to veto central government legislation that worked against their interests. For society to work fairly, Calhoun believed it was vital to protect the rights and interests of minorities.",

(1961) offers a clear response to elitist theorists, who had previously argued that American politics was dominated by a small number of people who controlled political decision-making through their wealth and influence. It puts forward a definition of political power as the ability to make others do what you want them to, and concludes that, while most people do not actively participate in politics and so do not exert a direct influence, power is still fragmented, and citizens indirectly shape decision-making.",

An action can only be considered “right” if it promotes the greatest amount of human happiness.

And if humans form political groups to become better human beings, the role of the state should be to support this endeavor by passing judicious laws and creating a good constitution. In this way the state helps its citizens lead a good life. Following on from this idea, Aristotle looks at the positives and negatives of different forms of state rule, and concludes that a “mixed constitution” is the best form of government, with power balanced between the many and the elite.",

            "Summary": "This means criminologists can look at measures of self-control in a person and predict how likely he or she is to commit a crime. Criminology theories that suggest people only break the law because of environmental factors do not take into account general human behavior and human nature. Self-control is a characteristic that forms early in a person’s life, and it is heavily influenced by a child’s relationship with his or her parent. A person’s level of self-control remains fairly stable after it is formed, meaning all types of crime can be explained in this way.",

            "Big Idea": "DREAMS REVEAL OUR UNCONSCIOUS DESIRES.",
            "Summary": "The unconscious mind transforms wishes into dreams if those wishes are too uncomfortable to acknowledge in an uncensored form. Our conscious minds censor these wishes in some way, so they only become apparent in our dreams; each dream is therefore a message in disguise and many of these wishes are about sexual urges. To understand the message, it is important to analyze and interpret the dream. An innovative way of interpreting dreams is through “free association,” where one person (the therapist, for instance) says a word and the other (the patient) responds immediately with another word. The words may have no obvious connection, but the therapist can use the sequence to interpret the workings of the patient’s unconscious mind.",

            "Summary": "Sometimes people don’t commit evil because they are inherently bad. Sometimes good people do evil things simply because of the bad situation they find themselves in. Why? Because certain situations contain such powerful psychological pressures to do wrong that most people just can’t resist. Stress, new surroundings, and peer pressure in a newly formed group can all contribute to a system that fosters bad behavior. So it is typically “bad barrels” rather than “bad apples” that cause these unpalatable human responses. Yet once we are aware of dangerous “situational forces,” it is possible for us to become heroes by actively resisting the urge to do evil.",

This kind of compliant behavior is clearly seen in the massacring of Jews under the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. But it is by no means restricted to a German mindset.

Governments can “nudge” citizens towards making better choices by changing the environment in which people make decisions. We can promote better eating by placing healthier foods like vegetables first in a cafeteria line of options. We can encourage employees to participate in a retirement savings plan by automatically enrolling them. But it is vital in these cases that people have the opportunity to opt out, so that their freedom of choice is not restricted.

Medical doctors, and neurologists in particular, need to pay more attention to the individual stories and struggles of these patients. Neurology has adopted a mechanical and impersonal approach to patient care, and this hurts not only patients, but practitioners as well. It limits a physician’s capacity to understand and then treat a patient’s condition.

They have become frustrated with their own situations, have lost all faith in themselves, and no longer value their individual identity. Mass movements step in to fill this void.

The answer is in their religions: while Catholics believed that all faithful people could attain salvation, some Protestant sects taught that God had predetermined who would and wouldn’t be saved. This meant that these particular Christians worked harder than their Catholic countrymen—seeing it as the only way to prove their worthiness. And all this hard work led them to amass more wealth. The Protestant work ethic therefore helped capitalism to develop and flourish, directly contradicting the Marxist theory of materialism.

Population growth, bad weather, and disease all placed constraints on centralized states’ ability to raise revenue. Fiscal crises followed, along with the rise of discontented elites who were excluded from the heart of the state system. These elites mobilized the masses—likewise unhappy because of their own material hardship—and revolt followed. Goldstone developed a formula known as the “political stress indicator” to measure the pressures faced by these centralized states.

            "Summary": "Even in the supposedly highly repressive nineteenth century, sex was discussed a lot. The Victorians may have tried not to talk about it, but they failed, as sex became an important part of scientific study. This research led to the creation of new categories for “normal” or “deviant” sex, governments wrote laws regulating those “deviant” practices, and the Roman Catholic Church called on its followers to regularly reveal their “deviant” sexual activities and thoughts in confession. By labeling sexual activities in this way, the authorities were seeking to control yet another part of their citizens’ lives.",

Freedom and catharsis must be achieved by any means necessary. For real change to happen, it must be the poor who are the driving force behind revolution. The middle classes will have done too well out of colonialism, so a new regime driven by them will be too similar to the old one.

But different social groups appear to have different suicide rates, and these rates remain more or less the same each year. It is the depth of connections between an individual and a particular social group, and the degree of moral regulation provided by that group, that determine a society’s suicide rates. Thorough statistical analysis of suicide rates using the tools of sociology is the way to reduce the number of suicides in our societies.",

But according to Foucault, the disappearance of these punishments for wrongdoers has little to do with benevolence. Today’s highly regimented prison systems are, in fact, part of a calculated move made by a number of modern institutions to assume more control over a state’s citizens. The prison system is designed to allow the observation and monitoring of prisoners, the better to control all aspects of their actions—and even their bodies. This level of control has now spread to schools, hospitals, military barracks, and workplaces. Indeed, now almost every environment is designed to train individuals to police themselves—to behave in a way that will gain approval from those in power. The old methods punished the body. The new methods want to punish the soul.",

When Westerners seized power in other countries, they erased the native culture and imposed their own cultural system. Fanon argues that this cultural takeover is racist and profoundly destructive. It forces colonized people to adapt to an alien set of values and assumptions, at the core of which is the belief that whites are superior to blacks. Compelling black people to accept this position forces them to regard themselves as subhuman and results in psychological trauma.
